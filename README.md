# Quiz Project

I created this project with desire and motivation because it already combines professional programmer skills and I wanted to test myself in these conditions. I chose the quiz with the help of my mentor, who helped me with the choice. The topic seemed very interesting to me and I tried to implement it as original as possible. I demonstrate what happened in this picture.
