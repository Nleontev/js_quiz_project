# Quiz Project

I created this project with desire and motivation because it already combines professional programmer skills and I wanted to test myself in these conditions. I chose the quiz with the help of my mentor, who helped me with the choice. The topic seemed very interesting to me and I tried to implement it as original as possible. I demonstrate what happened in this picture.

# Testing

I tested this project intensively and constantly because the need to check the functionality of the code when working with JavaScript appears constantly and I could not do without it. I also tested my project on different screens and below I will attach an example of displaying my project on a small screen. In the process of working on the project, the most difficult part was to figure out how to replace questions and this took the longest and most difficult stage of my work.
